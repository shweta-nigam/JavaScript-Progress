// The difference between null and undefined  ------

// null is the value we set
// undefined is something which never get assigned


//"Undefined is what you get. Null is what you set." ðŸ’¥

// undefined: JS's default â†’ "I forgot"

// null: Your decision â†’ "I know itâ€™s nothing"


let name;      
console.log(name)   // undefined  -- > because no value was assigned
console.log(typeof name);  // undefined

let age = null;
console.log(age);      // null -> deliberate empty value
console.log(typeof age);       // object
